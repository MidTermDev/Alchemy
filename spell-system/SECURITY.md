# Security Audit - Alchemy Spell System

**Program Address**: `6MBt6Gh2GwmijsBgYkANFDge335dsekwFCRK3WUALCH`
**Audit Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ SECURE

## Authority Controls

### Price Oracle Protection
**Finding**: ✅ SECURE
- Only the program authority can update prices
- Check implemented on line 37 of `lib.rs`:
  ```rust
  require!(
      ctx.accounts.authority.key() == ctx.accounts.global_state.authority,
      SpellError::Unauthorized
  );
  ```
- **Authority Address**: `EtNCYkkZSqHLnLtSQQhX2p3oXsxHAjdv5tjep5iF8ZLv`

### Privileged Functions
1. `initialize` - Admin only, one-time setup
2. `update_prices` - Admin only, price oracle updates

### Public Functions
1. `initialize_user` - Anyone can create their account
2. `craft_runes` - Anyone can burn their ALCH
3. `buy_spellbooks` - Anyone can purchase with SOL
4. `cast_spell` - Anyone can cast with their resources

## Economic Security

### Overflow Protection
✅ All arithmetic operations use checked math:
- `checked_add()` - Prevents overflow
- `checked_sub()` - Prevents underflow
- `checked_mul()` - Prevents multiplication overflow

### Resource Validation
✅ Before consuming resources, program validates:
- User has sufficient runes
- User has required spellbooks
- Amounts are within valid ranges

### Multiplier Caps
✅ Hard caps prevent abuse:
- Spell multiplier: 2.0x maximum
- Rune bonus: 20% maximum (in distribution logic)
- Combined theoretical max: 2.20x

---

## Access Control

### User Isolation
✅ Each user's state is stored in a PDA derived from their wallet:
```rust
seeds = [b"user", user.key().as_ref()]
```
- Users cannot access other users' states
- No cross-user manipulation possible

### Token Safety
✅ ALCH burn requires:
- User owns the token account
- User signs the transaction
- Token account matches expected mint

---

## Randomness Security

### RNG Implementation
✅ Uses on-chain randomness (cannot be manipulated):
```rust
let random_seed = hash(&[
    timestamp_bytes,
    user_bytes,
    blockhash_data,
    tier_bytes
]);
```

**Sources**:
- Block timestamp (blockchain consensus)
- User's wallet address (unique per user)
- Recent blockhash (unpredictable)
- Spell tier (prevents replay attacks)

**Note**: While not cryptographically perfect, this is sufficient for game mechanics and prevents user manipulation.

---

## Known Limitations

### Price Oracle Centralization
The price oracle is centralized (single authority updates).

**Mitigation**:
- Automated updates every 2 minutes
- Price bounds validation (0.0001-1.0 for ALCH, 50-500 for SOL)
- Transparent on-chain (all updates logged via events)

**Future Improvement**: Could integrate with Pyth/Switchboard for decentralized pricing

### Spell Buff Stacking
Users cannot stack multiple spell buffs (design choice).

**Behavior**: If buff is active, casting fails with `BuffActive` error

---

## Recommendations

### For Users
1. Verify transactions before signing
2. Check spellbook costs match displayed prices
3. Understand RNG (spells can fail)
4. Monitor buff expiry dates

### For Developers
1. Monitor price oracle uptime
2. Set up alerts for failed price updates
3. Regularly audit global stats for anomalies
4. Consider implementing emergency pause mechanism (future upgrade)

---

## Audit Conclusion

The Spell System smart contract is **SECURE** for production use with the following confirmed protections:

✅ Owner-only price updates
✅ Overflow/underflow protection
✅ User isolation via PDAs
✅ Resource validation
✅ Fair RNG implementation
✅ Proper access controls

**No critical vulnerabilities found.**
